# ATC-CNK-mapping-medications-belgium
[INTEGO](https://www.intego.be) project: cleaning of medications data. Also see [Healthdata collections](https://www.healthdata.be/dcd/#/collections) for a basic description of the INTEGO tables. This repo contains the code (Python in Jupyter Notebook) to extract ATC-CNK mapping table from publicly maintained data and a small R script to create the final mapping table.
